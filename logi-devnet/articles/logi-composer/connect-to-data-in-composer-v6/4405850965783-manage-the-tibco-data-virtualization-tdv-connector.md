# Manage the TIBCO Data Virtualization (TDV) Connector

# Manage the TIBCO Data Virtualization (TDV) Connector

The Composer Tibco connector lets you access the data available in your TIBCO Data Virtualization (TDV) storage using the Composer client. It supports TDV version 8.0-8.1 and has been tested with the following back-end databases:

| Database | Comments |
| --- | --- |
| MS SQL 14.0 |  |
| PostgreSQL 9.3 |  |
| Oracle 11 |  |
| MemSQL 6.7 | Wildcard filters don't work when a single quote is used in the search expression. |

Different data stores behave differently when comparing strings (for example, they handle white space and case sensitivity differently). For this reason, the Composer TDV connector supports the comparison behavior of the underlying data store and does not enforce a behavior of its own.

Before you can establish a connection from Composer to TDV, a connector server needs to be installed and configured.
See [*Manage Connectors and Connector Servers*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405859186199-Manage-Connectors-and-Connector-Servers) for general instructions and [*Connect to TDV*](#Connecti) for details specific to the Couchbase connector.

After the connector has been set up, you can create data source configurations that specify the necessary connection information and identify the data you want to use. See [*Manage Data Source Configurations*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405851027479-Manage-Data-Source-Configurations) for more information. After data sources are configured, they can be used to create dashboards and visuals from your data. See [*Create Dashboards*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405859261207-Create-Dashboards).

## Connect to TDV

The TDV connector requires a JDBC driver to be configured before you can connect to your data source. You can obtain the driver from the TDV installer distribution.

To connect to a TDV data store, you must specify the JDBC URL for the TDV database, and, if necessary, the username and password credentials for the TDV database. The structure of the connection URL is:

```
jdbc:compositesw:dbapi@<host>:<port>?domain=<domain>&dataSource=<datasource>
```

where

* `<host>` is the TDV server host name or IP address.
* `<port>` is the optional TDV server port for JDBC connections. The default is 9401.
* `<domain>` is the TDV domain in which the <datasource> belongs.
* `<datasource>` is the TDV data source to which you want to connect.

If you are upgrading, keep in mind you need to configure the JDBC driver - see [*Upgrade Composer*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405859509271-Upgrade-Composer) for instructions. For more information and steps, see [*Add a JDBC Driver*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405859376919-Add-a-JDBC-Driver).
