# Manage the Microsoft SQL Server Connector

# Manage the Microsoft SQL Server Connector

Composer's SQL Server connector lets you access the data available in the SQL query engine using the Composer client. Composer supports SQL Server 2008 R2 and 2019 versions (versions 10.5 through 15.0.2000).

Before you can establish a connection from Composer to SQL Server storage, a connector server needs to be installed and configured.
See [*Manage Connectors and Connector Servers*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405859186199-Manage-Connectors-and-Connector-Servers) for general instructions and [*Connect to Microsoft SQL Server*](#Connecti) for details specific to the Microsoft SQL Server connector.

After the connector has been set up, you can create data source configurations that specify the necessary connection information and identify the data you want to use. See [*Manage Data Source Configurations*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405851027479-Manage-Data-Source-Configurations) for more information. After data sources are configured, they can be used to create dashboards and visuals from your data. See [*Create Dashboards*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405859261207-Create-Dashboards).
