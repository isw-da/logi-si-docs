# Manage the SAP Hana Connector

# Manage the SAP Hana Connector

The Composer SAP Hana connector lets you access the data stored within your in-memory database using the Composer client. The Composer SAP Hana connector supports SAP Hana version 2.0.

Before you can establish a connection from Composer to SAP Hana storage, a connector server needs to be installed and configured.
See [*Manage Connectors and Connector Servers*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405859186199-Manage-Connectors-and-Connector-Servers) for general instructions and [*Connect to SAP Hana*](#Connecti) for details specific to the SAP Hana connector.

After the connector has been set up, you can create data source configurations that specify the necessary connection information and identify the data you want to use. See [*Manage Data Source Configurations*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405851027479-Manage-Data-Source-Configurations) for more information. After data sources are configured, they can be used to create dashboards and visuals from your data. See [*Create Dashboards*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405859261207-Create-Dashboards).

## Connect to SAP Hana

The SAP Hana connector requires a JDBC driver to be configured before you can connect to your data source. You can download the driver from the vendor's site. For information and steps, see [*Add a JDBC Driver*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405859376919-Add-a-JDBC-Driver).

When setting up a connection to SAP Hana, you need to provide the following:

* The name of the connection
* The JDBC URL. The format for the JDBC URL must be as follows: `jdbc:sap://SAPHANAHOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME` For example, `jdbc:sap://10.2.2.135:39013.`
* The username and password, if applicable.
