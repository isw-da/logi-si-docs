# Upload a Flat File into Composer

# Upload a Flat File into Composer

Composer can visualize data from flat files including CSV, JSON, and TSV files. Note the following:

* The maximum supported file size is 500 MB
* Data from the flat file is stored in a PostgreSQL database

Before you can establish a connection from Composer to your flat file storage, a connector server needs to be installed and configured. See [*Manage Connectors and Connector Servers*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405859186199-Manage-Connectors-and-Connector-Servers) for general instructions and [*Connect to the Flat File*](#Connecti) for details specific to the flat file connector.

After the connector has been set up, you can create data source configurations that specify the necessary connection information and identify the data you want to use. See [*Manage Data Source Configurations*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405851027479-Manage-Data-Source-Configurations) for more information. After data sources are configured, they can be used to create dashboards and visuals from your data. See [*Create Dashboards*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405859261207-Create-Dashboards).

## Connect to the Flat File

For details about what is provided on each page of the connection process, review the topic [*Manage Data Source Configurations*](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405851027479-Manage-Data-Source-Configurations) . When you connect to a flat file, the data source configuration wizard includes a Data tab instead of a Connection tab. On the Data tab, select a CSV, JSON, or TSV file to upload. Messages on the Data tab warn you if the file you select has problems or requirements that need to be corrected in the source file before proceeding.
