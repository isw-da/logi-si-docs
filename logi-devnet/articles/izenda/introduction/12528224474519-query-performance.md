# Query Performance

There are several factors related to optimal query performance.

## Optimized Data Model

Izenda moves as fast as your data allows.

* Izenda leverages directly off reporting databases. Izenda by default does not
  store any data and is, therefore, a query executor and performs as
  efficiently as the databases that it sits on top of.
* As of v3.3.0, Izenda provides an optional caching layer to improve performance,
  but this will store data either on the disk itself or in memory.
* Provide views and stored procedures at the database layer whenever
  possible to streamline complex queries and data setup. Izenda allows
  for similar functionality to be built on-the-fly but this will ensure
  that the performance is specifically tailored to your data.

## Izenda Fusion

Izenda allows users to connect to multiple databases and create
relationships between them through a method known as Izenda Fusion.

* Databases are not required to be on the same machine since each
  database has it’s own unique connection string
* Databases do \*not\* have to be of the same type. For instance, you
  can “fuse” a MySQL Database with an Microsoft SQL Database.
* Izenda’s Fusion engine leverages asynchronous querying in tandem with
  in memory query tree and map reduce technologies. This enables fast
  cross database querying and multi-step calculations.
* Izenda can connect to and query multiple databases asynchronously,
  and then aggregate returned data in memory before sending to client
  for rendering.
