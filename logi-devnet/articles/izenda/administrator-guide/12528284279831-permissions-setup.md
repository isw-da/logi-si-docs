# Permissions Setup

# Permissions Setup

## What are Permissions?

Permissions are how you grant functionality to users in your instance of Izenda. These include several areas like:

> * Controlling what types of report parts they can create
> * Setting who they can share their reports with
> * Determining if they can access and manipulate their tenant’s data model

In a multi-tenant instance you can set permission at both the tenant and role level. In this scenario, the tenant will act like a ceiling for a role’s permissions.

> * If a tenant object does not have access to a particular permission, then no roles within that tenant can have access to that permission
> * Tenant permissions will generally be inherited down into the role permissions when you are creating new roles within that tenant

## Permissions Overview

A permissions object is comprised of several areas

> **System Configuration**
>
> * Scheduled Instances

## Difference Between Tenant Permissions and Role Permissions

Permissions can be set in two place: at the tenant level and at the role level. While a majority of the permission objects are the same, there are some difference between them.

> * Tenant Level Differences
>   :   + Tenant Access Checkboxes
>         :   - This column of checkboxes along the right-hand side of the permissions tab determines if these permission are visible during the Role Setup process
>               :   * If Tenant Access is not set, then you will not see that permission during role setup, but the role will still inherit what is set behind the scenes
>                   * If Tenant Access is set, then you will see that permission during role seutp and can choose to remove that permission from that particular role
>             - If this checkbox is set AND the corresponding permission is set, then you will be able to disable or enable this option on a per-role basis during role setup.
> * Role Level Differences
>   :   + Full Report and Dashboard Access
>         :   - This permission will make this role a reporting power user. They will be able to access every report and dahsboard regardless of this role’s data access or Access Rights that are set on a report
>       + Report Category Accessibility
>         :   - This dialogue will determine the visiblity/access this role has to the corresponding report category
>             - It is dividied into three containers:
>               :   * Available Categories
>                     :   + This container will show all report categories that exist in the tenant
>                   * Visible Categories
>                     :   + This container will show any report categories that users in this role can see reports within
>                   * Categories Allowed for Saving Reports
>                     :   + This container will show any report categories that users in this role can save reports within
>             - NOTE: This dialogue is changed automatically by the Access Rights that get set on certain reports
>       + Dashboard Category Accessibility
>         :   - This dialogue will determine the visiblity/access this role has to the corresponding report category. It is dividied into three containers:
>               :   * Available Categories
>                     :   + This container will show all dashboard categories that exist in the tenant
>                   * Visible Categories
>                     :   + This container will show any report dashboard that users in this role can see reports within
>                   * Categories Allowed for Saving Reports
>                     :   + This container will show any report dashboard that users in this role can save reports within
>             - NOTE: This dialogue is changed automatically by the Access Rights that get set on certain reports

## Difference Between System Level Roles and Tenant Level Roles

Roles can exist at both the system level and the tenant level. While a majority of both roles are the same, roles at the system level have a unique Tenant Setup category of their permissions object.

> * Tenant Setup
>   :   + Actions
>         :   - Create
>               :   * This permission grants access for the role to create new tenants
>             - Edit
>               :   * This permission grants access for the role to edit existing tenants
>             - Delete
>               :   * This permission grants access for the role to delete existing tenants
>       + Permissions
>         :   - This permission will determine if this role has access to the Tenant Setup tab of the Settings page

## Permission Settings that Impact UI Elements

Some of the permissions, when not granted to a tenant/role, will cause some of Izenda’s UI elements to not render on certain pages. Below are a list of the elements, by page, that can be configured by certain permissions
