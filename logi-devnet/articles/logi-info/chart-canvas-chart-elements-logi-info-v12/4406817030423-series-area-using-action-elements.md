# Series.Area - Using Action Elements

Action elements initiate processing of a report or process task definition, redirection to a link, or other processing when a data point in the series is clicked.

In the example above, an **Action.Report** element has been added as a child of the Series, along with its **Target.Report** and **Link Parameters** child elements. To reference chart data in parameters, use the @Chart token, as shown above.

A variety of Action elements are available for use with Series, including Action.Link, Action.Process, and Action.Refresh Element. Additional Action elements will be added in future releases.
