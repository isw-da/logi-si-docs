| Dataset | Indicates the dataset used by the object. This property is read only. |
| Instance Name | Shows the instance name of the object. This property is read only. |
| Geometry | |
| Height | Specifies the height of the object. Type a numeric value to change the height. Data type: Float |
| Width | Specifies the width of the object. Type a numeric value to change the width. Data type: Float |
| X | Specifies the horizontal coordinate of the top left corner of the object, relative to its parent container. This property is ignored if the [Position](#Position) property is set to static. Type a numeric value to change the position. Data type: Float |
| Y | Specifies the vertical coordinate of the top left corner of the object, relative to its parent container. This property is ignored if the [Position](#Position) property is set to static. Type a numeric value to change the position. Data type: Float |
| Others | |
| Auto Scale in Number | Specifies whether to automatically scale the values that are of the Number data type in the object when the values fall into the two ranges:  * When 1000 <= value < 10^15, the following quantity unit symbols of the International System of Units are used to scale the values: K (10^3), M (10^6), G (10^9), and T (10^12). * When 0 < value < 0.001 or value >= 10^15, scientific notation is used to scale the values.   Data type: Boolean |
| Default for Filter | Specifies whether to show the data component as the default component in the Apply To drop-down list of the Filter dialog box in Page Report Studio. Data type: Boolean  Note icon In a report, you can set only one data component’s Default for Filter property to true. |
