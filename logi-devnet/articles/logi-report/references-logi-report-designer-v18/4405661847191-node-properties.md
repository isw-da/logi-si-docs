# Node Properties

This topic describes the properties of the Node object in an organization chart.

Designer provides some properties only when you use the object in certain [report types](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405661831319-Report-Object-Properties#ReportType). You can get details from the Available For column in the property table.

| Property Name | Available For | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General | | |
| Class Type | Query Page Report | Indicates the class type of the object. This property is read only. |

| Instance Name | Query Page Report | Shows the instance name of the object. This property is read only. |
| Geometry | | |
| Height | Page Report, Web Report, Library Component | Specifies the height of the object. Type a numeric value to change the height. Data type: Float |

| Color | | |
| Background | Page Report, Web Report, Library Component | Specifies the background color of the object.

For example, if you define the CSS file as follows:  `@charset "GBK";  TextField {Background: #ff0000}  /*Style=LabelX*/  TextField[Style="LabelX"]{Background: #0000FF}  /*ID=W*/  TextField#W{Background: #FFFF00}   /*class=C*/  TextField.C{Background: #00FFFF}`  To apply the Class Selector in the file to the object, type **C** in the value cell.  Data type: String |

You can specify the style in two ways:  * Type the style which should be an Attribute Selector whose attribute is "style" in the CSS file of the style the report applies.
