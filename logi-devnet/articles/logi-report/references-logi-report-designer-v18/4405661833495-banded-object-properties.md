# Banded Object Properties

This topic describes the properties of a [Banded Object](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405661345431-Working-with-Banded-Objects) that you can use in page reports and web reports.

Designer provides some properties only when you use the object in certain [report types](https://devnet.logianalytics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405661831319-Report-Object-Properties#ReportType). You can get details from the Available For column in the property table.

| Property Name | Available For | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General | | |
| Class Type | Query Page Report | Shows the class type of the object. This property is read only. |

| Width | Page Report, Web Report | Designer enables this property for a vertical banded object. You can use it to specify the width of the object. Type a numeric value to change the width. Data type: Float |
| X | Page Report, Web Report | Specifies the horizontal coordinate of the object's top left corner, relative to its parent container, which Logi Report Engine applies when the object is not in static [position](#Position) in the container. Type a numeric value to change the coordinate. Data type: Float |
| Y | Page Report, Web Report | Specifies the vertical coordinate of the object's top left corner, relative to its parent container, which Logi Report Engine applies when the object is not in static [position](#Position) in the container. Type a numeric value to change the coordinate. Data type: Float |
