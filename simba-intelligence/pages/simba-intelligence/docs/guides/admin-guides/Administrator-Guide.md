   ```
3. **Configure chat capability**:

   ```
   model_name:  us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6
   temperature: 0.7        (optional, global)
   max_tokens:  10000      (optional, global — set explicitly for Claude Sonnet)
   ```

### Provider Management Best Practices

**Security management:**

* **Rotate API keys** regularly according to security policies
* **Monitor usage and costs** for all configured providers
* **Set up alerts** for unusual usage patterns or cost spikes
* **Use separate credentials** for development and production environments

**Performance optimization:**

* **Configure multiple providers** for redundancy and load distribution
* **Monitor response times** and adjust provider priorities as needed
* **Set appropriate timeout values** to balance performance and reliability
* **Cache frequently used responses** to reduce API calls and costs

**Cost management:**

* **Monitor token usage** across all providers to understand costs
* **Set up usage alerts** to prevent unexpected charges
* **Optimize model selection** based on use case requirements
* **Implement usage quotas** for different user groups if needed

## System Configuration

### API and Integration Management

#### API Key Management

**System API keys:**

* **Administrative API keys**: Keys with full system access for automation
* **Service account keys**: Keys for system-to-system integration
* **User API keys**: Keys for individual user programmatic access
* **Integration keys**: Keys for specific third-party integrations

**API key lifecycle:**

1. **Creation**: Generate keys
2. **Distribution**: Securely provide keys to authorized users or systems
3. **Rotation**: Regularly rotate keys according to security policies
4. **Revocation**: Immediately revoke compromised or unused keys

#### External Integration Configuration

**Third-party integrations:**

* **Business intelligence tools**: Configure connections to Tableau, Power BI, etc.
* **Data catalogs**: Integrate with enterprise data catalog solutions
* **Monitoring systems**: Connect to APM and infrastructure monitoring tools
* **Identity providers**: Configure SAML, OIDC, or LDAP integrations

## Troubleshooting and Support

### Common Administrative Issues

#### User Access Issues

**"User cannot access expected features"**

**Diagnosis steps:**

1. **Check user roles**: Verify correct roles are assigned in user management
2. **Permission inheritance**: Ensure roles provide expected permissions
3. **Session refresh**: Have user log out and back in to refresh permissions
4. **Cache clearing**: Clear application cache if permission changes don't take effect

**Resolution process:**

1. **Verify role assignment** in admin interface
2. **Check navigation menu** appearance for user
3. **Test specific functionality** user should be able to access
4. **Monitor audit logs** for permission-related errors

#### LLM Configuration Problems

**"AI provider not responding or returning errors"**

**Troubleshooting checklist:**

* **Credential validation**: Verify API keys or service account credentials are correct
* **Quota and billing**: Check AI provider account for quota limits or billing issues
* **Network connectivity**: Ensure Simba Intelligence can reach AI provider endpoints
* **Rate limiting**: Check if requests are being rate-limited by provider

**Resolution approaches:**

1. **Test credentials** directly with provider's tools or APIs
2. **Monitor usage** in provider's dashboard or console
3. **Check error logs** for specific error messages
4. **Implement retry logic** and backoff strategies for temporary issues

#### Performance Issues

**"System responding slowly or timing out"**

**Performance diagnosis:**

1. **Check system resources**: Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage
2. **Database performance**: Analyze slow query logs and connection counts
3. **Network latency**: Test connectivity to AI providers and databases
4. **Cache effectiveness**: Monitor cache hit rates and memory usage

**Optimization strategies:**

* **Scale resources**: Increase CPU, memory, or replica count as needed
* **Optimize queries**: Work with database teams to improve query performance
* **Implement caching**: Enable semantic caching for frequently used queries
* **Load balancing**: Distribute load across multiple instances

### System Diagnostics

#### Diagnostic Information Collection

**For troubleshooting, collect:**

```bash theme={null}
# System status
kubectl get pods -n simba-intelligence
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n simba-intelligence

# Application logs
kubectl logs deployment/simba-intelligence-website -n simba-intelligence

# Resource usage
kubectl top pods -n simba-intelligence
kubectl top nodes

# Database status
psql -h localhost -U simba_user -c "SELECT version();"
psql -h localhost -U simba_user -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Cache status
redis-cli info memory
redis-cli info clients
```

#### Support Escalation Procedures

**When to escalate issues:**

* **System-wide outages** affecting multiple users
* **Security incidents** or suspected breaches
* **Data corruption** or loss scenarios
* **Performance degradation** that cannot be resolved through standard troubleshooting

**Information to provide when escalating:**

* **System configuration**: Environment details and deployment information
* **Error messages**: Complete error logs and stack traces
* **Reproduction steps**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
* **Impact assessment**: Number of affected users and business impact
* **Mitigation attempts**: What troubleshooting steps have already been tried
