## User Authentication

### Authentication Flow

Simba Intelligence uses a token-based authentication system with automatic renewal to provide secure, seamless user access.

#### Login Process

1. **User Login**: User provides credentials (username/password)
2. **Credential Validation**: System validates against configured authentication provider
3. **Token Generation**: System generates secure access token with expiration
4. **Session Establishment**: User session created with appropriate permissions
5. **Token Renewal**: Automatic token refresh before expiration

#### Token Management

**Token lifecycle:**

```
Login → Token Issued (Valid 1 hour) → Auto-Renewal (if active) → Session Timeout/Logout
```

**Token characteristics:**

* **Expiration**: Default 1-hour lifetime with automatic renewal
* **Scope**: Contains user identity and role information
* **Storage**: Securely cached in browser with automatic cleanup

### Authentication Methods

#### Local Authentication

**Default authentication using Simba Intelligence user accounts:**

* Username and password stored securely in the system
* Password complexity requirements configurable
* Account lockout protection after failed attempts
* Password expiration and rotation policies

**User account creation:**

1. **Administrator creates account** through user management interface
2. **Initial credentials** provided securely to user
3. **First login** may require password change
4. **User profile** populated with role assignments and permissions

***

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Permission Hierarchy

Simba Intelligence implements a hierarchical permission system where higher-level roles include all capabilities of lower-level roles.

### Permission Enforcement

#### UI-Level Access Control

**Navigation menu adaptation:**

* Menu items appear only for users with appropriate permissions
* Disabled or hidden interface elements for restricted functions
* Role-based redirection to appropriate landing pages

**Example navigation for different roles:**

```javascript theme={null}
// Supervisor sees all menu items
[Home, Data Agent, Data Sources, Data Connections, Playground, Admin]

// ROLE_CREATE_SOURCES sees
[Home, Data Agent, Data Sources, Playground]

// Basic User sees  
[Home, Playground]
```

#### API-Level Authorization

**Every API request validated:**

* **Token validation**: Verify user authentication token
* **Permission check**: Ensure user has required role for requested operation
* **Resource access**: Verify user can access specific data sources or resources
* **Action authorization**: Confirm user can perform the requested action

**Authorization flow:**

```
API Request → Token Validation → Role Check → Resource Access Check → Action Execution
```

### Dynamic Permission Evaluation

#### Context-Aware Permissions

**Permissions evaluated based on:**

* **User roles**: Assigned roles and their associated capabilities
* **Data source access**: Specific permissions for individual data sources
* **Resource ownership**: Access to user-created resources
* **Time-based access**: Configurable time-based access restrictions

#### Permission Caching and Performance

**Efficient permission checking:**

* **Permission cache**: User permissions cached in session for performance
* **Cache invalidation**: Automatic cache refresh when roles change
* **Minimal latency**: Sub-millisecond permission checks for common operations

***

## API Security

### API Key Management

#### Personal API Keys

**Users can create and manage personal API keys:**

* **Self-service creation**: Users generate their own API keys through the interface
* **Permission inheritance**: API keys inherit the user's role-based permissions
* **Key rotation**: Users can regenerate keys as needed for security

**API key management interface:**

* **Key generation**: Create new API keys with custom names/descriptions
* **Key visibility**: Toggle between masked and visible key display
* **Key deletion**: Remove compromised or unused keys
* **Usage monitoring**: Track API key usage patterns

#### API Key Security Features

**Security measures:**

* **Key masking**: Keys displayed as `••••••••` by default with reveal option
* **Audit logging**: All API key operations logged for security monitoring

### API Authentication

#### Authentication Methods

**Bearer token authentication:**

```bash theme={null}
# API request with authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
     https://your-domain/api/v1/query
```

**Authentication flow:**

1. **Client includes API key** in Authorization header
2. **Server validates key** against stored keys
3. **User permissions retrieved** based on key owner
4. **Request processed** with user's permission context

### API Security Best Practices

#### For API Users

**Secure API key handling:**

* **Never commit keys to version control** or share in plain text
* **Use environment variables** to store keys in applications
* **Rotate keys regularly** according to security policies
* **Monitor key usage** for unexpected activity

**Request security:**

* **Always use HTTPS** for API requests
* **Validate responses** and handle errors appropriately
* **Implement retry logic** with exponential backoff
* **Log API usage** for debugging and monitoring

#### For Administrators

**API security monitoring:**

* **Monitor API usage patterns** across all users
* **Set up alerts** for unusual activity or potential abuse
* **Regular security audits** of API key usage and permissions
* **Enforce corporate policies** for API key management

***

## Data Security

### Data Source Access Control

#### Permission-Based Data Access

**Data source security layers:**

1. **Connection-level**: User must have appropriate role to use data connections
2. **Source-level**: Specific permissions required for individual data sources
3. **Query-level**: Row and column-level security applied during queries
4. **Result-level**: Additional filtering applied to query results

### Credential Management

#### Secure Credential Storage

**Database connection credentials:**

* **Encryption at rest**: All credentials encrypted using strong encryption
* **Secure transmission**: Credentials transmitted only over encrypted connections
* **Access control**: Only authorized systems can access stored credentials

#### AI Provider Credential Security

**LLM provider API keys:**

* **Encrypted storage**: All AI provider credentials encrypted at rest
* **Scope limitation**: Credentials configured with minimal necessary permissions

### Data Privacy and Compliance

#### Data Processing Privacy

**Data sent to AI providers:**

* **Query text**: Natural language questions (may contain business context)
* **Schema information**: Table and column names for query generation
* **No raw data**: Actual data values never sent to external AI services

**Data retention and privacy:**

* **Local processing**: Data analysis performed within your infrastructure
* **Minimal external data**: Only metadata sent to AI providers
* **Data sovereignty**: Support for regional data processing requirements

## Troubleshooting Security Issues

### Common Authentication Problems

#### Login Failures

**"Invalid username or password"**

* **Verify credentials**: Ensure username and password are correct
* **Check account status**: Verify account is not locked or disabled
* **Password expiration**: Check if password has expired

**"Session expired"**

* **Token renewal**: Check if automatic token renewal is working
* **Session timeout**: Verify session timeout configuration
* **Network connectivity**: Ensure stable connection during session
* **Clear browser cache**: Try clearing cookies and browser cache

#### Permission Issues

**"Access denied" or "Insufficient permissions"**

* **Role verification**: Check user's assigned roles in user management
* **Permission propagation**: Wait for permission changes to take effect
* **Resource-specific access**: Verify user has access to specific data sources
* **Session refresh**: Log out and back in to refresh permissions

### API Authentication Issues

#### API Key Problems

**"Invalid API key"**

* **Key format**: Verify API key format and completeness
* **Key status**: Check if API key has been revoked or expired
* **User permissions**: Ensure API key owner has required permissions
* **Rate limiting**: Check if requests are being rate limited

**API key management issues:**

* **Key visibility**: Use reveal toggle to verify key is copied correctly
* **Key rotation**: Generate new key if current key is compromised
* **Permission inheritance**: Verify user's role provides necessary API permissions
