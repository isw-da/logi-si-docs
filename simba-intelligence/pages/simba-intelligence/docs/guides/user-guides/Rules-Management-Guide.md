# Rules Management Guide

# Rules Management Guide

Rules let you shape how Simba Intelligence's AI agents behave—both the **Data Source Agent** (when creating new data sources) and the **Query Agent** (when interpreting and answering user questions). A rule is a short, plain‑English instruction that adds governance, tone, context, constraints, or business logic beyond what is inferred from schemas and data source configuration.

***

## Overview

### What Are Rules?

Think of rules as lightweight guardrails or behavioral hints you layer on top of your existing semantic model. They do **not** replace data source optimization (see the Data Source Optimization Guide), but they help:

* Emphasize important business definitions
* Enforce preferred terminology
* Prevent disallowed insights or perspectives
* Guide tone, style, or emphasis for generated explanations
* Remind the AI of contextual constraints (“Never expose raw cost fields unless explicitly asked”)

### Rule Targets

A rule can apply to:

* **None (Global for Query)** – Applies to *all* user queries across every data source unless overridden by explicit user instruction
* **Specific Data Source** – Applies only when querying that data source
* **Data Source Agent** – Applies when the AI is *creating* new data sources via the Data Agent (useful for structural / naming / compliance guidance)

> 💡 If you choose **None**, the rule does *not* constrain creation logic directly—it's interpreted during natural language querying across any data source. To influence creation, target the Data Source Agent explicitly or define both types of rules.

### When to Use Rules

Use Rules when you need:

* Consistent phrasing (e.g., “Use ‘Customer’ instead of ‘Client’ in explanations”)
* Guardrails (“Do not include speculative forecasting unless user asks for a prediction”)
* Compliance reinforcement (“Do not surface personally identifiable information (PII) in summaries”)
* Analytical posture (“Prioritize variance explanations over raw totals when comparing periods”)
* Data Source creation standards (“Prefer concise, business-readable field labels; expand abbreviations”)

## Key Concepts

| Attribute   | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name        | Human-readable identifier shown in the Rules list                                                                                       |
| Content     | The actual instruction (plain English) – required                                                                                       |
| Data Source | Optional selection; empty = global (query) scope; specific = scoped; agent = creation context (if UI supports explicit agent targeting) |
| Created At  | Timestamp (UTC) when the rule was created                                                                                               |

> 🧩 The UI currently exposes: **Name**, **Content**, and **Data Source selector** with a `None` option. Selecting none yields a global query rule. Selecting a data source scopes it. (If/when an explicit “Data Source Agent” target option is added, include one rule per structural policy.)

### How the AI Uses Rule Names

The **Rule Name is not just cosmetic**. The AI performs lightweight semantic relevance matching using rule names as signals to decide which optional rules to load for a given task context (especially when many global rules exist). A weak or vague name can cause the system to overlook an otherwise useful rule.

**Implications:**

* Names should summarize *intent + domain* ("Privacy: Suppress PII" vs "PII Stuff")
* Avoid generic labels ("General", "Style", "Rule 1")
* Prefer consistent prefixes so related rules cluster during relevance scoring
* If two rules have overlapping names, disambiguate with scope or outcome wording (e.g., "Terminology: Gross vs Net" vs "Terminology: Acronym Expansion")

**Name Structure Template:**
`CATEGORY: Focus – Qualifier`

**Examples:**

* `PRIVACY: Suppress PII Fields`
* `TERMINOLOGY: Use “Gross Revenue” Label`
* `TONE: Executive Summary First`
* `STRUCTURE (Creation): Expand Abbreviations`
* `COMPARISON: Highlight Drivers Before Totals`

**Anti‑Patterns:**

* `Revenue` (too vague)
* `Tone Rule` (uninformative)
* `DSAgent` (unclear function)
* `AOV` (acronym with no context)

> 🎯 Goal: A reviewer (or the AI) should infer the rule’s purpose without reading its content.

## Multi-Tenancy and Rule Scope

### Tenant-Wide Rules vs User Rules

In multi-tenant deployments, rules can have two scopes:

**User Rules (Personal):**

* Created by individual users for their own use
* Visible and editable only by the user who created them
* Applied automatically during queries alongside tenant-wide rules
* All users can create, edit, and delete their own user rules

**Tenant-Wide Rules (Organizational):**

* Created by tenant administrators
* Automatically applied to all users within the tenant
* Visible to all users but only editable by tenant administrators
* Useful for enforcing organization-wide policies, compliance requirements, and consistent business logic

### Rule Display and Organization

The Rules interface displays rules in two separate sections:

**For Tenant Administrators:**

* **Tenant Rules** table at the top - shows all tenant-wide rules with full edit/delete controls
* **User Rules** table below - shows your personal rules with full edit/delete controls

**For Standard Users:**

* **Tenant Rules** table at the top - shows tenant-wide rules (read-only, no action buttons)
* **User Rules** table below - shows your personal rules with full edit/delete controls

> 💡 **Tip:** If you only see one table, there are no tenant-wide rules in your organization. This is normal for non-multi-tenant deployments or tenants without organizational rules.

### Creating Tenant-Wide Rules (Administrators Only)

Tenant administrators have an additional option when creating rules:

1. Navigate to **Rules** and click **Create Rule**
2. Fill in Name, Content, and optional Data Source as usual
3. Check the **"Apply across tenant"** checkbox
4. Click **Create Rule**

The rule immediately becomes visible and active for all users in your tenant.

**Use cases for tenant-wide rules:**

* **Governance**: "Do not surface personally identifiable information (PII) in summaries unless explicitly asked"
* **Compliance**: "All financial figures must include currency clarification (USD)"
* **Terminology**: "Use 'Customer' instead of 'Client' in all explanations"
* **Data quality**: "When comparing periods, prioritize variance drivers before totals"

### Interaction Between Tenant and User Rules

* Both tenant-wide rules and user rules are applied during queries
* Tenant-wide rules cannot be overridden or disabled by standard users
* User rules work alongside tenant rules to add personal preferences
* If rules conflict, more specific guidance typically takes precedence
* Data source-scoped rules (whether tenant-wide or personal) apply when querying that specific source

**Example:**

* Tenant-wide rule: "Always clarify currency as USD"
* User rule: "Begin summaries with top 3 drivers"
* Result: Both apply - currency is clarified AND summaries prioritize drivers

***

## Accessing Rules Management

1. Navigate to **Rules** from the user menu in the top-right corner
2. The Rules interface displays existing rules organized by scope (Tenant Rules and User Rules)
3. Use the **Search** box to filter by rule name across both sections
4. Click **Create Rule** to add a new rule (user rule by default; tenant administrators can check "Apply across tenant")

***

## Creating a Rule

### Steps

1. Click **Create Rule**
2. Enter a **Rule Name** (concise, descriptive)
3. (Optional) Choose a **Data Source** from the dropdown:
   * Leave blank = global query rule
   * Select a data source = scoped rule for that source only
4. Enter **Rule Content** – write a direct instruction (avoid fluff)
5. Click **Create Rule**

### Content Writing Guidelines

**✅ Do:**

* Be explicit: “Always describe currency values in USD unless user specifies another currency.”
* Use imperative tone: “Prioritize…” “Avoid…” “Never…” “When comparing…”
* Keep one intent per rule; create multiple rules instead of a long paragraph
* Reference business terminology exactly as labeled in the data source

**❌ Avoid:**

* Vague phrasing: “Be smart about revenue stuff.”
* Overloaded instructions mixing tone, filtering, formatting in one rule
* Duplicating what the data source schema already makes obvious

### Example Rules

| Name                   | Scope                    | Content                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Revenue Terminology    | Global                   | Use the term “Gross Revenue” instead of generic “Revenue” when summarizing totals.                       |
| Cost Visibility        | Global                   | Do not include cost or margin fields unless the user explicitly asks for cost, margin, or profitability. |
| Sales Source Tone      | Sales Performance Source | Summaries should emphasize drivers of change (top 3 product categories and regions) before totals.       |
| Naming Standards       | Data Source Agent        | When creating data sources, expand abbreviations in labels (e.g., `rev_gross_amt` → `Gross Revenue`).    |
| Currency Clarification | Sales Performance Source | If user asks for revenue without specifying currency, clarify that figures are in USD.                   |

## Editing a Rule

1. In the Rules table, click the **Edit** (pencil) icon
2. Adjust **Name**, **Content**, or **Data Source**
3. (Tenant administrators only) Toggle the **"Apply across tenant"** checkbox to change rule scope
4. Click **Save Changes**
5. Confirm success via toast message

> ✏️ Editing scope (changing from global to specific, or from user to tenant-wide) changes where the rule applies immediately.

**Note:** Standard users can only edit their own user rules. Tenant-wide rules have no edit buttons for standard users.

***

## Deleting a Rule

1. Click the **Delete** (trash) icon next to a rule
2. Confirm in the deletion modal
3. Rule is permanently removed; behavior reverts accordingly

> 🛑 This cannot be undone—capture critical governance rules elsewhere (internal documentation / version control).

**Note:** Standard users can only delete their own user rules. Tenant-wide rules have no delete buttons for standard users. Only tenant administrators can delete tenant-wide rules.

***

## Searching and Filtering

Use the search input at the top of the page to filter by **Rule Name**. (Search currently does not inspect rule content.) For large catalogs of rules, adopt consistent naming prefixes (e.g., `GOV:`, `TONE:`, `CALC:`).

**Naming Pattern Suggestions:**

* `GOV: Data Privacy`
* `FORMAT: Currency`
* `TONE: Executive Summaries`
* `MODEL: Abbreviation Expansion`

***

## Best Practices

### Keep Rules Atomic

One rule = one behavioral constraint. Easier to maintain, disable, or refine.

### Use Hierarchical Intent

* Rely on **data source configuration** for structural clarity
* Use **rules** for behavioral overlays (tone, selective suppression, explanation priorities)

### Avoid Rule Overlap

Too many similar or conflicting rules can cause diluted adherence.

### Optimize Names for AI Selection

Because the AI scores rule names for contextual relevance:

* **Front‑load the category** so related rules cluster (`PRIVACY:`, `TONE:`, `FORMAT:`)
* **Use strong action verbs** ("Suppress", "Highlight", "Use", "Avoid", "Explain")
* **Disambiguate variants** (e.g., `TERMINOLOGY: Margin vs Markup` distinct from `TERMINOLOGY: Acronym Expansion`)
* **Flag creation-specific rules** with a suffix or parenthetical `(Creation)` or `(Data Source Agent)` until dedicated targeting UI exists
* **Refactor legacy names** that are overly short—rename rather than layering new rules on top

**Before / After Examples:**

| Before           | After                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Cost Rule        | PRIVACY: Suppress Cost & Margin Unless Asked         |
| Naming Standards | STRUCTURE (Creation): Expand Abbreviations in Labels |
| AOV              | TERMINOLOGY: Use “Average Order Value” (Not AOV)     |
| Style            | TONE: Executive Summary Before Detail                |

**Removal Checklist for Weak Names:**
Delete or rename if the name is: single-word generic, ambiguous acronym, or duplicates another rule with only minor differences.

### Review Regularly

Quarterly or after major schema/label changes, audit rules for redundancy or obsolescence.

### Traceability

Maintain a simple changelog externally (date, rule added/retired, rationale). This supports governance and auditability.

## Common Use Case Patterns

| Scenario                    | Example Rule                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Suppress sensitive fields   | Do not surface user email addresses in summaries unless explicitly asked.              |
| Force explanation structure | Begin summaries with a variance explanation before totals if a comparison is implied.  |
| Enforce naming conventions  | Replace internal acronym “AOV” with “Average Order Value” in all user-facing wording.  |
| Clarify assumptions         | If timeframe not specified, clarify the default time range before answering.           |
| Guide creation style        | When creating data sources, prefer descriptive business names over system codes.       |
| Limit speculation           | Do not generate forward-looking forecasts unless user explicitly asks for predictions. |

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                                  | Possible Cause                                    | Resolution                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rule appears ignored                   | Too vague; conflicts with stronger schema signals | Rewrite using specific verbs and domain terms           |
| Conflicting behaviors                  | Multiple rules say opposite things                | Consolidate; keep the clearer one                       |
| Hard to locate rule                    | Inconsistent naming                               | Adopt prefixes / naming taxonomy                        |
| Overly verbose summaries               | Tone or structure rules encourage narration       | Tighten rules to focus on insight hierarchy             |
| Sensitive data surfaced                | No rule suppressing it; field visible             | Hide field OR add suppression rule                      |
| Can't edit tenant-wide rule            | You're a standard user; only admins can edit      | Contact your tenant administrator to modify the rule    |
| Can't see "Apply across tenant" option | You don't have tenant administrator permissions   | This feature is only available to tenant administrators |

***

## Governance Recommendations

1. **Baseline Set**: Create a minimal core pack (Privacy, Tone, Terminology, Structural Guidance).
2. **Expansion Policy**: Require justification for each new rule (what problem does it solve?).
3. **Sunset Review**: Mark candidate rules for removal if unused or superseded.
4. **Change Communication**: Notify analysts when global rules change—they may observe shifts in summarization style.

***

## FAQ

**Q: Do rules change underlying query logic?**\
A: They influence interpretation and summarization, not raw database access—underlying permissions and schema still govern data availability.

**Q: Can a scoped rule override a global rule?**\
A: Yes—scoped rules provide additional, more specific context when that data source is queried.

**Q: How many rules is too many?**\
A: If you need more than \~25 active rules, consider consolidation or moving structural guidance into data source configuration.

**Q: Should I duplicate a global rule inside every data source?**\
A: No. Use a single global rule unless a source needs a tailored variation.

**Q: What if users explicitly request something a rule discourages?**\
A: Well‑written rules typically allow explicit user intent to override (e.g., “unless the user explicitly asks”). Phrase accordingly.

***

## Summary & Next Steps

Rules complement (not replace) strong data modeling. Start with a focused set that enforces privacy, terminology, and analytical framing. Expand carefully, review regularly, and retire obsolete rules.

**Suggested follow-up actions:**

* Draft a core governance ruleset (4–6 rules)
* Audit for redundant or unclear existing rules
* Add a naming taxonomy prefix if absent
* Pair this with the Data Source Optimization checklist for holistic quality control

*Ready to add or refine rules? Open the Rules interface and apply these patterns—each clear rule compounds overall AI reliability and user trust.*
