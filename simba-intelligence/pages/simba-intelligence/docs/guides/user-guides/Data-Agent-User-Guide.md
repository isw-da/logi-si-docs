# Data Agent User Guide

# Data Agent User Guide

The Data Agent is Simba Intelligence's AI-powered tool for automatically creating data sources. Instead of manually configuring database connections and schemas, you simply describe what you need or upload a screenshot of your desired dashboard, and the AI agent handles the technical setup for you.

## Overview

### What is the Data Agent?

Think of the Data Agent as your intelligent data assistant. Just as you might describe a project to a colleague and have them set up the necessary resources, the Data Agent listens to your data requirements and automatically:

* **Analyzes your needs** from text descriptions or dashboard images
* **Connects to your databases** using available data connections
* **Creates optimized data sources** ready for querying
* **Configures relationships and fields** based on your requirements

### When to Use the Data Agent

**Perfect for:**

* Creating new data sources for dashboards or reports
* Prototyping data connections quickly
* Converting dashboard mockups into working data sources
* Exploring new databases without manual schema analysis

**Example scenarios:**

* *"I need to analyze our sales performance by region and product category"*
* *"Create a data source for this customer dashboard mockup"*
* *"Set up connections to track inventory levels across our warehouses"*

***

## Prerequisites

Before using the Data Agent, ensure you have:

### 1. Required Permissions

## Creating Data Sources

The Data Agent supports two primary input methods for understanding your requirements:

### Method 1: Text Description

**Best for**: Clear data requirements, existing knowledge of your data structure

1. **Click "Get Started"** on the Data Agent welcome screen
2. **Describe your data needs** in the text area (optional). Be specific about:
   * **What data you want to analyze**
   * **Key metrics or fields of interest**
   * **Intended use case or analysis goals**

**Example descriptions:**

```
Sales Analysis:
I need to analyze our sales performance data including:
- Revenue by product category and region
- Monthly and quarterly trends
- Customer segmentation analysis
- Top-performing sales representatives

Include data from our CRM and ERP systems where possible.
```

```
Inventory Management:
Create a data source for warehouse inventory tracking:
- Current stock levels by location
- Product movement history
- Reorder points and alerts
- Supplier performance metrics

Focus on our main distribution centers.
```

### Method 2: Image Analysis (Dashboard Mockups)

**Best for**: Visual dashboard designs, mockups, screenshots of desired outputs

1. **Upload an image** of your desired dashboard or data visualization
2. **Supported image formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG (max 10MB)
3. **Drag and drop or click** to browse for your image file
4. **Add context** (optional): Include additional text description to clarify requirements

**What the AI analyzes in images:**

* Chart types and visualizations
* Data labels and field names
* Filters and interactive elements
* Layout and grouping patterns
* Implied data relationships

> **🔍 Image Analysis Tip**: The AI works best with clear, well-labeled dashboard mockups. Hand-drawn sketches work too, as long as labels and relationships are visible.

### Method 3: Combined Approach

For best results, combine both methods:

1. Upload a dashboard mockup or screenshot
2. Add text description with additional context and requirements
3. Specify any particular data sources or constraints
