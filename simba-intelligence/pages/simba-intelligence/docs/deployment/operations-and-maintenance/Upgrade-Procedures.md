# Upgrade Procedures

# Upgrade Procedures

This guide covers strategic upgrade procedures for Simba Intelligence deployments using Helm charts in Kubernetes environments.

> **Audience Note:** This guide assumes familiarity with Kubernetes, Helm, and basic upgrade planning principles. For foundational knowledge, refer to the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/).

> **Production Note:** Always test upgrades in non-production environments before applying to production systems. Follow your organization's change management and approval processes.

## Overview

Successful upgrades require careful planning, appropriate backup strategies, and understanding the scope of changes in each version type. This guide focuses on Helm-based upgrade strategies that integrate with your existing operational practices.

***

## Pre-Upgrade Planning

### Backup Strategy

Before any upgrade, ensure comprehensive backup coverage:

**Critical Backup Components:**

* **Database Backups** - Complete PostgreSQL database snapshots
* **Persistent Volume Snapshots** - All persistent data and configuration
* **Helm Configuration** - Current values and deployment state
* **Kubernetes Resources** - ConfigMaps, Secrets, and custom resources

**Backup Verification:**
Verify that your backup systems are functioning correctly and restoration procedures are tested. Your backup strategy should align with your organization's data protection and recovery requirements.

### Version Assessment

**Version Type Classification:**

* **Major.Minor Versions** (e.g., 25.2 → 25.3 or 26.0) - May include significant changes
* **Revision Updates** (e.g., 25.2.1 → 25.2.2) - Primarily bug fixes and patches

**Pre-Upgrade Review:**

* Review release notes, and helm readme for breaking changes
* Assess impact on existing integrations
* Verify compatibility with current infrastructure
* Plan for any required configuration updates

## Upgrade Strategies

### Major/Minor Version Upgrades

For major or minor version changes, use a conservative approach to minimize risk:

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Scale Down Deployments and StatefulSets** - Temporarily scale deployments to zero replicas
2. **Update Application** - Deploy new version via Helm upgrade
3. **Verify Functionality** - Confirm system health and schema updates completed successfully

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Planned Maintenance Window** - Schedule during low-usage periods
* **Extended Downtime Planning** - Communicate expected downtime to users
* **Rollback Readiness** - Ensure quick rollback capability if issues arise

### Revision Upgrades

For revision updates (patch releases), normal rolling updates are typically appropriate:

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Rolling Update** - Use Helm's default rolling update strategy
2. **Monitor Deployment** - Watch for any deployment issues
3. **Verify Health** - Confirm system continues operating normally

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Configuration-Dependent Risk** - Risk level depends on StatefulSet configuration and replica counts
* **Continuous Monitoring** - Watch application metrics during update
* **Quick Detection** - Be prepared to identify any unexpected issues

***

## Upgrade Execution

### Helm Upgrade Process

**Basic Upgrade Command Structure:**

```bash theme={null}
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] oci://docker.io/insightsoftware/simba-intelligence-chart --namespace [NAMESPACE] --version [VERSION]
```

**Key Upgrade Parameters:**

* **Version Specification** - Always specify exact chart version
* **Values Preservation** - Use `--reuse-values` or provide updated values
* **Timeout Configuration** - Set appropriate timeout for your environment
* **Rollback on Failure** - Configure automatic rollback behavior

### Upgrade Monitoring

**During Upgrade:**

* Monitor pod rollout status
* Watch for any error conditions
* Track resource utilization
* Verify service connectivity

**Health Verification:**

* Application health endpoints respond correctly
* Database connectivity is maintained
* All expected services are running
* Integration points continue functioning

***

## Post-Upgrade Verification

**Essential Verification Steps:**

* Confirm all services are running and healthy
* Verify core application functionality works as expected
* Validate performance meets baseline requirements
* Test critical integration points
* Document upgrade completion and any issues encountered

**Communication:**
Follow your organization's established procedures for communicating upgrade completion and system status updates.

***

## Rollback Procedures

### When to Rollback

Consider rollback when:

* Critical functionality is impaired
* Performance degradation exceeds acceptable thresholds
* Integration failures prevent normal operation
* Data integrity concerns arise

### Rollback Execution

**Rollback Procedure:**

1. **Scale Down Services** - Temporarily scale deployments and StatefulSets to zero replicas
2. **Restore Backups** - Restore database and persistent data from pre-upgrade backups
3. **Helm Rollback** - Rollback to previous chart release
4. **Verify Functionality** - Confirm system health after rollback

**Helm Rollback:**

```bash theme={null}
helm rollback [RELEASE_NAME] [REVISION] --namespace [NAMESPACE]
```
