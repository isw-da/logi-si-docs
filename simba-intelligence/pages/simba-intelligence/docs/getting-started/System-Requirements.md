# System Requirements

# System Requirements

This document outlines the infrastructure and software requirements for deploying Simba Intelligence in Kubernetes environments using Helm charts.

> **⚠️ Important Note:** Application resource requirements can vary widely depending on your deployment configuration. The Discovery/Composer instance, Redis, and PostgreSQL can all be external services. For production deployments, external PostgreSQL is recommended. These specifications serve as a general guide - expect to right-size resources based on your individual use case and external service configuration.

***

## Kubernetes Infrastructure Requirements

### Cluster Specifications

**Minimum Cluster Requirements:**

* **Kubernetes Version**: 1.24+
* **Node Count**: 2+ worker nodes for production deployments
* **Storage Support**: Persistent volume support with dynamic provisioning
* **Container Runtime**: Docker 20.10+ or containerd 1.6+

**Sizing Strategy:**

* **Initial Deployment**: Overprovision resources initially to establish baseline performance
* **Right-Sizing**: Analyze actual usage patterns and resource consumption after deployment
* **Scaling Approach**: Application usage varies dramatically based on use cases - monitoring and adjustment is essential
* **Performance Tuning**: Use observed metrics to optimize resource allocation over time

***

## Application Resource Requirements

### Core Components

**Simba Intelligence Application:**

* **Minimum**: 4 CPU cores, 8GB memory total
* **Recommended**: 8+ CPU cores, 16GB+ memory total
* **Scaling**: Supports horizontal scaling with multiple replicas
* **Components**: Includes web application, background workers (Celery), scheduler (Beat), and database migration jobs

### Optional Built-in Services

**Discovery/Composer Services:**

* **System Requirements**: See [Composer System Requirements](https://logi-composer-v25.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/34933082999693-System-Requirements) for detailed specifications
* **Recommendation**: Use external services for production deployments

**PostgreSQL Database:**

* **Recommendation**: Use external managed database for production

**Redis Cache:**

* **Recommendation**: Use external Redis service for production

***

## Software Dependencies

### Required Components

**Kubernetes Platform:**

* **Kubernetes**: Version 1.24 or later
* **Helm**: Version 3.17+ for chart management
* **Container Runtime**: Docker 20.10+ or containerd 1.6+
* **Network Plugin**: CNI-compatible networking

**Storage Requirements:**

* **StorageClass**: Default storage class with dynamic provisioning
* **Persistent Volumes**: Support for ReadWriteOnce volumes; ReadWriteMany may be required for Composer built-in volume (driver deployment)
* **Backup**: Volume snapshot capability recommended

**Ingress and Networking:**

* **Ingress Controller**: Functional ingress controller for external access
* **DNS**: Functional cluster DNS

**Database**

* **Postgres**: Postgres is required, and an external managed database is recommended for production instead of the built-in service.

***

## Network Requirements

**External Access:**

* **Internet**: Outbound internet access for container image pulls
* **Load Balancer**: External access for users
* **SSL/TLS**: Certificate management for secure connections

**Internal Communication:**

* **Pod-to-Pod**: Standard Kubernetes cluster networking
* **Service Discovery**: Functional Kubernetes service discovery

**Security:**

* Implement appropriate network policies for production environments
