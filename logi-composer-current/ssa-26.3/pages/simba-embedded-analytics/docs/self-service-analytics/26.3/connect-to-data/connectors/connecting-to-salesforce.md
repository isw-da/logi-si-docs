# Manage the Salesforce Connector

The Self-Service Analytics Salesforce connector lets you access the data available in Salesforce. Obtain the connector server following this process: [Obtain Additional Connector Servers](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/connect-to-data/connectors/connectors-ov#obtain-additional-connector-servers)

After setting up the connector, create data sources that specify the necessary connection information and identify the data you want to use. See [Create and Manage Data Sources](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/connect-to-data/sources/data-source-config-overview) for more information. After you set up your data sources, create [dashboards](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/analyze-data/dashboards/dash-manage#create-dashboards), [self service reports](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/analyze-data/ssr-manage), and [visuals](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/analyze-data/visuals/visual-add-dash#create-and-add-visuals-to-the-visual-gallery) from the data in these data sources.

To connect Self-Service Analytics to your Salesforce instance, provided the JDBC url, a Salesforce user name, and password or API token.

| Input Field | Description |
| - | - |
| JDBC Url | jdbc:salesforce://localhost;Endpoint=https\://your\_salesforce\_endpoint/services/Soap/u/48.0 |
| User Name | Your Salesforce user name |
| Password | Your Salesforce user password |

  Optimize Performance
</h3>

The Salesforce connector is a raw data connector. Data retrieved from the data source is processed by the QueryEngine service. When you retrieve and manipulate large chunks of data, consider the following practices to improve performance speed:

* Create your source using custom SQL and fusion source interfaces
* Limit your query using a `WHERE` clause and `TOP`
* Narrow your data retrieval by filtering your data
* Speed your initial load time by defining a small time range on the [Global Settings tab](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/connect-to-data/sources/data-source-config-global-settings-tab#time-bar-settings)

#### Raw Data Cache

You can reduce the number of queries Self-Service Analytics makes to the source and speed up data query execution by enabling raw data caching. When enabled, an **Entity Data Cache** toggle is added to the Source Creation work area. Enable and define a caching schedule. Contact [Technical Support](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/get-started/tech-support) for assistance enabling this feature.
