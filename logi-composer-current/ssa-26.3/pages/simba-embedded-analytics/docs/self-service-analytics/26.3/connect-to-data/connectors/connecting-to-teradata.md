# Manage the Teradata Connector

The Self-Service Analytics Teradata connector lets you access the data available in Teradata databases using the Self-Service Analytics client. The Teradata connector supports Teradata version 16.20.

Before you can establish a connection from Self-Service Analytics to Teradata storage, a connector server needs to be installed and configured. See [Manage Connectors and Connector Servers](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/connect-to-data/connectors/connectors-ov#manage-connectors-and-connector-servers) for general instructions and [Connect to Teradata](#connect-to-teradata) for details specific to the Teradata connector.

After setting up the connector, create data sources that specify the necessary connection information and identify the data you want to use. See [Create and Manage Data Sources](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/connect-to-data/sources/data-source-config-overview) for more information. After you set up your data sources, create [dashboards](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/analyze-data/dashboards/dash-manage#create-dashboards), [self service reports](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/analyze-data/ssr-manage), and [visuals](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/analyze-data/visuals/visual-add-dash#create-and-add-visuals-to-the-visual-gallery) from the data in these data sources.

The Teradata connector requires a JDBC driver to be configured before you can connect to your data source. You can download the driver from the vendor's site. If you are upgrading, keep in mind you need to configure the JDBC driver - see [Upgrade Self-Service Analytics](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/administer/install/upgrading-server) for instructions. For more information and steps, see [Add a JDBC Driver](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/administer/install/install-ov#add-a-jdbc-driver).

You can limit the list of available collections in a Teradata data store to collections from a specific schema specified in the Teradata JDBC URL. Use the Teradata JDBC URL `database` property to limit the list of available schemas as well as the list of available collections to collections from the schema. For example:

```
jdbc:teradata://<url>/dbs_port=<port>,database=<schema>
```

<Warning>
  Work with your Teradata database administrator configure connection to your database.
