# Manage the Business Central Jet Connector

The Self-Service Analytics Business Central Jet connector lets you access the data stored Business Central databases using the Self-Service Analytics client using the available API.

Before you can establish a connection from Self-Service Analytics to Business Central databases, a connector server needs to be installed and configured. See [Manage Connectors and Connector Servers](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/connect-to-data/connectors/connectors-ov#manage-connectors-and-connector-servers) for general instructions and [Connect to Business Central](#connect-to-business-central) for details specific to this connector.

After setting up the connector, create data sources that specify the necessary connection information and identify the data you want to use. See [Create and Manage Data Sources](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/connect-to-data/sources/data-source-config-overview) for more information. After you set up your data sources, create [dashboards](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/analyze-data/dashboards/dash-manage#create-dashboards), [self service reports](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/analyze-data/ssr-manage), and [visuals](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/analyze-data/visuals/visual-add-dash#create-and-add-visuals-to-the-visual-gallery) from the data in these data sources.

Connector support for specific [features](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/connect-to-data/connectors/connector-feature-support) is shown in the following table.
