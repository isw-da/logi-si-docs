# Manage the TIBCO Data Virtualization (TDV) Connector

The Self-Service Analytics Tibco connector lets you access the data available in your TIBCO Data Virtualization (TDV) storage using the Self-Service Analytics client. It supports TDV version 8.0-8.1 and has been tested with the following back-end databases:

| Database | Comments |
| - | - |
| MS SQL 14.0 | |
| PostgreSQL 9.3 | |
| Oracle 11 | |
| MemSQL 6.7 | Wildcard filters do not work when a single quote is used in the search expression. |

Different data stores behave differently when comparing strings (for example, they handle white space and case sensitivity differently). For this reason, the Self-Service Analytics TDV connector supports the comparison behavior of the underlying data store and does not enforce a behavior of its own.

Before you can establish a connection from Self-Service Analytics to TDV, a connector server needs to be installed and configured. See [Manage Connectors and Connector Servers](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/connect-to-data/connectors/connectors-ov#manage-connectors-and-connector-servers) for general instructions and [Connect to TDV](#connect-to-tdv) for details specific to the Couchbase connector.

After setting up the connector, create data sources that specify the necessary connection information and identify the data you want to use. See [Create and Manage Data Sources](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/connect-to-data/sources/data-source-config-overview) for more information. After you set up your data sources, create [dashboards](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/analyze-data/dashboards/dash-manage#create-dashboards) and [visuals](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/analyze-data/visuals/visual-add-dash#create-and-add-visuals-to-the-visual-gallery) from the data in these data sources.

  Connect to TDV
</h3>

The TDV connector requires a JDBC driver to be configured before you can connect to your data source. You can obtain the driver from the TDV installer distribution.

To connect to a TDV data store, you must specify the JDBC URL for the TDV database, and, if necessary, the username and password credentials for the TDV database. The structure of the connection URL is:

```
jdbc:compositesw:dbapi@<host>:<port>?domain=<domain>&dataSource=<datasource>
```

where

* `<host>` is the TDV server host name or IP address.
* `<port>` is the optional TDV server port for JDBC connections. The default is 9401.
* `<domain>` is the TDV domain in which the \<datasource> belongs.
* `<datasource>` is the TDV data source to which you want to connect.

If you are upgrading, keep in mind you need to configure the JDBC driver - see [Upgrade Self-Service Analytics](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/administer/install/upgrading-server) for instructions. For more information and steps, see [Add a JDBC Driver](/simba-embedded-analytics/docs/self-service-analytics/26.3/administer/install/install-ov#add-a-jdbc-driver).
