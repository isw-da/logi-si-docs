# Manage the Cloudera Search Connector

# Manage the Cloudera Search Connector

Composer supports Cloudera Search version 4.10 - 7.4.

Before you can establish a connection from Composer to Cloudera Search storage, a connector server needs to be installed and configured.
See [Manage Connectors and Connector Servers](https://logi-composer-v26.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/43701042404749-Manage-Connectors-and-Connector-Servers) for general instructions and [Connect to Cloudera Search](#Connecti) for details specific to the Cloudera Search connector.

After setting up the connector, create data sources that specify the necessary connection information and identify the data you want to use. See [Manage Data Sources](https://logi-composer-v26.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/43701068934669-Manage-Data-Sources) for more information. After you set up your data sources, create [dashboards](https://logi-composer-v26.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/43701076467981-Create-Dashboards) and [visuals](https://logi-composer-v26.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/43701179894541-Create-and-Add-Visuals-to-the-Visual-Gallery) from from the data in these data sources. See [Create Dashboards](https://logi-composer-v26.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/43701076467981-Create-Dashboards).
