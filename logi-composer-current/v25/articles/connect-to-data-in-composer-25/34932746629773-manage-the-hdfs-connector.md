# Manage the HDFS Connector

# Manage the HDFS Connector

Composer offers connection to Cloudera’s open source Hadoop platform - Cloudera Distributed Hadoop (CDH)\*. CDH provides unified batch processing, interactive SQL, interactive search, and role-based access controls. In addition, it offers enterprise-grade continuous availability. Specifically, Composer connects to CDH’s fault‐tolerant storage system called the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

The Composer HDFS connector uses its own embedded Apache Spark functionality. It supports Apache Spark 2.2 in its implementation.

By default, the HDFS connector is not included with Composer. You or your administrator need to download and enable it before configuring the connector.

After setting up the connector, create data sources that specify the necessary connection information and identify the data you want to use. See [Manage Data Sources](https://logi-composer-v25.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/34932941009037-Manage-Data-Sources) for more information. After you set up your data sources, create [dashboards](https://logi-composer-v25.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/34932763355021-Create-Dashboards) and [visuals](https://logi-composer-v25.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/34933273224589-Create-and-Add-Visuals-to-the-Visual-Gallery) from from the data in these data sources. See [Create Dashboards](https://logi-composer-v25.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/34932763355021-Create-Dashboards).
