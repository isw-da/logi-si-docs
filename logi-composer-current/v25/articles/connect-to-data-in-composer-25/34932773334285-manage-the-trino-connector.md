# Manage the Trino Connector

# Manage the Trino Connector

The Composer Trino connector connects to a Trino server, and verified with versions 351-390. Trino is the new brand name for Presto.

You might use the Composer Trino connector to connect to a Trino server on which the Trino connector is installed. After the connection is made, you would then be able to visualize and explore data in the PostgreSQL or AWS S3 database using the Composer client.

The Trino connector has been validated and tested with PostgreSQL or AWS S3 databases only. Composer cannot guarantee bug-free operation of the Trino connector with other databases, although you can try to use Trino to connect to them.

Before you can establish a connection from Composer to the Trino server, the Trino connector server must be installed, configured and enabled. See [Manage Connectors and Connector Servers](https://logi-composer-v25.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/34932741363981-Manage-Connectors-and-Connector-Servers) for general instructions and [Connect to Trino](#Connecti) for details specific to the Trino connector.

After setting up the connector, create data sources that specify the necessary connection information and identify the data you want to use. See [Manage Data Sources](https://logi-composer-v25.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/34932941009037-Manage-Data-Sources) for more information. After you set up your data sources, create [dashboards](https://logi-composer-v25.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/34932763355021-Create-Dashboards) and [visuals](https://logi-composer-v25.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/34933273224589-Create-and-Add-Visuals-to-the-Visual-Gallery) from from the data in these data sources. See [Create Dashboards](https://logi-composer-v25.insightsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/34932763355021-Create-Dashboards).
